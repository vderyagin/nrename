# Nrename

Command-line utility for renaming numbered files.

## Installation ##

```
gem install nrename
```

## Compatibility ##

* ruby-1.8.7
* ruby-1.9.2
* ruby-1.9.3
* jruby (both 1.8 and 1.9 modes)
* rubinius (both 1.8 and 1.9 modes)

## Description ##


When you have a set of files like:

```
1.txt
2.txt
10.txt
11.txt
99.txt
100.txt
```

it's hard to get a list of them in order (from `1.txt` to `100.txt`). Shell of
file manager will usually sort them starting from first symbol in filename,
like this:

```
1.txt
10.txt
100.txt
11.txt
2.txt
99.txt
```

Nrename lets you rename such files so that they have equal number of digits in
names:

```
001.txt
002.txt
010.txt
011.txt
099.txt
100.txt
```

## Usage ##

```
$ nrename --help
<%= `./bin/nrename --help`.chomp %>
```
